  <div class = "HighLineWidth">I used docker in general. I used MySQL for the back-end, 
    pyramid python, and JavaScript in case there will be a 
    dynamic interaction between the user with the server. <br>
    Same Connection set up between front-end and back-end in 140A. 
    The Main addition so far is the live website and CSS styling.</div>
